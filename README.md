# Subway Server Game

## Project Description

Subway Server is a game written in C# with Monogame in Visual Studios as the final project for my grade 11 computer science class (ISC3U). It received a mark of 100% and helped me achieve a final course mark of 100%. Inspired by the cooking games from Flipline Studios, this game simulates working at a Subway.

This game is created from scratch - it displays an extraordinary manipulation of graphics and sounds while employing a friendly user controls. All the graphics of the game are created or edited by using Pixlr, Paint 3D, and Paint. This project demonstrates a mastery of the fundamentals of C# learned in the course. 

## How to Install and Run the Game

In order to run the game, Visual Studios 2019 is required. The entire folder, Escape, can be cloned on to your own machine to be run. 

## How to Play

Objective: Run the Subway restaurant to the best of your ability to earn points and tips. Your score depends on the customer's waiting time, cutting score, toasting score, and toppings score. Earning tips allows you to buy upgrades for the restaurant. The game gets harder as the day number increases - more customers visit the shop. 

To navigate between stations of the restaurant, press A and D. To check the notepad with the customer's orders, press W. You can flip through the orders by pressing A and D. To close the notepad, press S.
